        Our house is situated on the first level of the city, so the view from our windows is limited to the street and the front houses. But don't let that dissuade you from experiencing the true beauty of Gondor through the eyes of a true defender. Our home may be simple, but it is clean, cozy, and equipped with everything you need to make your stay comfortable and memorable.
        
        As a Citadel Guard, I have dedicated my life to protecting this great city and its people. And now, I invite you to join us and experience the heart and hospitality of a true defender. Though we may not offer breathtaking views from our windows, the true beauty of Gondor lies in its people and history.
        
        And if you're lucky, you may even get the chance to meet my dear friend, a wise wizard who occasionally graces us with his presence. His stories and advice about Middle-earth will leave you inspired and enriched.
