"Welcome, my friends! I am Blinsky, the greatest toymaker in all of Barovia. I am delighted to invite you to my home where you can see my wonderful creations and enjoy a comfortable stay.

My home is filled with the fruits of my labor - toys and other charming curiosities that I have crafted with great care and skill. While some may find them strange, I can assure you that they are not macabre or disturbing in any way. They are simply unique and delightful works of art that will bring a smile to your face.

As my guests, you will be treated to the finest hospitality that I can offer. Whether you need a cozy bed to rest in, a warm meal to fill your belly, or just a friendly face to talk to, I will be here to provide for your every need.

Of course, I must warn you that Barovia is a dangerous place, full of shadows and other threats. But never fear, for my trusty creations will keep you safe from harm. You will never forget your stay in my home, and I can promise you that it will be an experience like no other.

So come and join me in my little corner of Barovia. I promise that you will not be disappointed."
